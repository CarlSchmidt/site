  <h2>Mercury's Atmosphere</h2>
  <p>Gas in Mercury's atmosphere is so rarified that collisions between particles occur with negligible frequency. Like the atmospheres of Earth's Moon and Jupiter's moon, Europa, we refer to this as a surface-bound exosphere and it's an environment where the standard definitions of pressure and temperature do not apply. It's composition reflects the rocky surface material: calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, iron, aluminum, manganese, oxygen, as well as some elements that are brought in part from solar wind like hydrogen and helium. Photo-desorption, meteorite impacts, themal evaporation and sputtering are all processes that sustain a very thin atmosphere on this planet. For nearly 40 years, the community has debated the relative importance of each process on the different atmospheric constituents. Progress has been incremental with consensus being hard won, and many major resolutions have resulted from the MESSENGER spacecraft in 2011-2015.</p>   
  <p>Since solar photons impart momentum when they scatter off the atoms, sunlight blows Mercury's atmosphere into a comet-like tail. The photon scattering rate is particularly strong for alkali metals like sodium and potassium. Scattering depends on Mercury's Doppler shift and distance relative to the Sun, so the atmospheric escape rate is very dependent on season. Using a small 10 cm coronagraph at McDonald Observatory, I've recorded the sodium atmosphere extending to distances of 2.5 million km, making it one of the largest structures in our solar system. In the image below, the field of view is 7 degrees of sky, Mercury is behind the black filter strip, the Pleaides are to the right, and trees on the horizon are smeared by tracking during this 6 minute exposure.</p> <img src="Mercury/Coronagraph_Example_30_April_2009.png" alt="Coronagraph" align="left"> 
  <p>Below is a movie of Mercury's comet-like tail as seen over 2 days aboard the HI-1 instrument on the Sun-orbiting STEREO-A spacecraft. The waves moving through the background are due to Thomson scattering of electrons in the solar wind. The tail shows characteristics common to sodium, although this prognosis in composition is not yet definite. Mercury's tail points nearly along the line of sight, whereas these solar wind structures scatter preferentially perpendicular. This means that the planet is in the foreground and the solar wind is in the background, and so my 'white whale' of observing the atmosphere react to solar activity is not acheivable by this technique. </p>

<p>McDonald Observatory is also home to a small 40 cm telescope with a fiber-fed instrument. To the best of my knowledge, it's the world's only integral-field echelle spectrograph, designed by Jeff Baumgardner of Boston University. This instrument simultaneously records 246 high resolution spectra over just 4 nm of free spectral range, where each is separated by 8 arcseconds on the sky. Optimizing the data reduction and calibration procedure has taken me nearly 8 years to get right and works like this:
