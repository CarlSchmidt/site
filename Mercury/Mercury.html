  <h2>Mercury's Exosphere</h2>
  <p>Gas in Mercury's atmosphere is so rarified that collisions between particles occur with negligible frequency. Like the atmospheres of Earth's Moon and Jupiter's moon, Europa, we refer to this as a surface-bound exosphere and it's an environment where the standard definitions of pressure and temperature do not apply. It's composition reflects the rocky surface material: calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, iron, aluminum, manganese, oxygen, as well as some elements that are partly brought in from solar atmosphere like hydorgen and helium.</p>
  <p>Since solar photons impart momentum when the scatter off the atmosphere, sunlight blows Mercury's atmosphere into a comet-like tail. The photon scattering rate is particularly strong for alkali metals like sodium and potassium. Scattering depends on Mercury's Doppler shift and distance relative to the Sun and so the atmospheric escape rate is very dependent on season. Using a small 10 cm coronagraph at McDonald Observatory, I've recorded the sodium atmosphere extending to distances of 2.5 million km, making it one of the largest structures in our solar system.</p>
  <p>Below is a movie of Mercury's tail as seen over 2 days aboard the HI-1 instrument on the Sun-orbiting STEREO-A spacecraft. The waves moving through the background are due to Thomson scattering of electrons in the solar wind. The tail shows characteristics common to sodium, although this composition is not definite. Mercury's tail points nearly along the line of sight, whereas these solar wind structures scatter preferentially perpendicular. This means that Mercury is in the foreground and the solar wind is in the background, and so my "white whale" of observing the atmosphere react to solar drivers is not possible with this technique. </p>
