  <h2><p align="center">Lunar Sodium Exosphere</p></h2>

It has been 20 years since the discovery of the comet-like tail in the lunar sodium exosphere. Ground-based telescopes in the late 1980's first showed that the Moon has sodium in its thin exosphere and that this gas could be readily observed out to a few lunar diameters. In 1998, during an observing campaign at the McDonald Observatory to study the effects of the Leonid meteor shower on
the terrestrial (mesospheric) sodium layer, a fortuitous discovery was made of a faint spot of sodium emission near the anti-Sun/Moon direction. This spot was observed on two consecutive nights, drifting eastward along the ecliptic. The feature was finally determined to be the comet-like tail of the escaping at New Moon. As this gas cloud passes by the Earth, gravity alters the atomic trajectories and focuses the cloud analagous to a lens. Back scatter from the focal point is the "Moon Spot" and <a href="http://sirius.bu.edu/moontail/">here</a> is a more complete description of this cool phenomenon. Jody Wilson coded up a simulation:

Recently our group has been trying to use the Moon spot to infer some physical properties of the Lunar exosphere. This task is complicated by viewing geometry. The shape/location/brightness of the Moon Spot differs depending on the observer's location. Below shows an example from Mt John New Zealand blinked with the concurrent observation at McDonald Observatory highlighting these differnces.

Viewing effects also have the consequence that the moonspot changes over the course of a few hours. The video below was taken by Jeff Baumgarnder with his 10cm coronagraph at McDonald Obsevatory. The observations were a few hours after solar eclipse when the Moon was right on the ecliptic plane, producing a very bright Moon Spot at lower left. Jupiter's sodium nebula due to Io's volcanic outgassing is seen at center. This date was also near Jovian opposition---a rare coincidence in alignment and the only time both objects are in the same 7.5 degree field of view! Some thin high cloud cover causes more scattered light giving the flashing effect around Jupiter. Morphology in the Moon Spot at lower left is due both to the Earth-Moon system geometry and to the Earth's rotation changing the viewer's perspective via parallax.
