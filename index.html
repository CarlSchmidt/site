<a id="About" class="anchor" href="#About" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About</h3>

<p>I'm a research scientist at the Boston University <a href="http://www.bu.edu/csp/" class="CSP">Center for Space Physics</a>
studying tenuous planetary atmospheres, also known as exospheres. Prior, I was a post-doc at <a href="http://www.latmos.ipsl.fr/" class="LATMOS">CNRS/LATMOS</a>, where I maintain a joint appointment, and a post-doc at 
<a href="http://www.virginia.edu/ms/research/rej/index.html/" class="UVA">University of Virginia</a>. This site contains scattered bits of information about my various projects. </p>


<h3>
<a id="Instruments" class="anchor" href="#Instruments" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Instruments</h3>

<p>Atmospheres of the bodies below are being actively studied using the Rapid Imaging Planetary Spectroagraph (RIPS), a new instrument built here at Boston University. It's currently installed on the AEOS 3.7m telescope at Haleakala. <a href="RIPS.html">More about RIPS</a> </p>

<h3>
<a id="Mercury" class="anchor" href="#Mercury" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mercury</h3>

<p>Mercury's atmospheric content is comparable to the air in a small building, spread over the whole planet. Still, the extreme brightness of the sodium and potassium D emission lines are easily observed via small ground-based telescopes. Interpreting such observations, alongside the extensive <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/messenger/main/">MESSENGER</a> dataset, however requires complex numerical models and so their development is one of my main projects. <a href="Mercury/Mercury.html">More on Mercury</a> </p>

<h3>
<a id="Comets" class="anchor" href="#Comets" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Comets</h3>

<p>Cometary atmospheres are rich in complexity. Using an integral field spectrograph, I've studied the composition, structure, and dynamics of Comet C/2012 S1 (ISON), which, well. . . fell into the Sun. Then I worked with the STEREO spacecraft to study striae formation in Comet C/2011 L4 (Pan-STARRS). Now I'm onto another comet, 46P/Wirtanen, which will make a pass near Earth in December 2018.</p>

<h3>
<a id="Io" class="anchor" href="#Io" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Io</h3>

<p>Jupiter's volcanic moon Io is certainly one of the most interesting object's in our Solar System. I use infrared wavelengths to study volcanoes on its surface, various telescopes to observe its atmospheric changes and escape, and a spectrograph at Apache Point Observatory to track a wobbly doughnut orbiting Jupiter called the Io Plasma Torus. Current work revolves around coordinated datasets using <a href="RIPS.html">RIPS</a>, <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/get-proposal-info?id=15147&observatory=HST">Hubble's Cosmic Orgins Spectrograph</a> and Apache Point. I also lead some ground-based telescope efforts for <a href="https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/planned-observations">Juno mission support</a> related to Io studies. </p>

<h3>
<a id="Europa" class="anchor" href="#Europa" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Europa</h3>

<p>Io can potenitally transfer some of its massively extended atmosphere to an adjacent moon, Europa. I'm currently working on a better understanding of the fraction of the sodium in Europa's atmosphere that is transferred from Io, rather than of native origins. Addressing this question ultimately helps solve another; what is the salinity of Europa's subsurface ocean?</p>

<h3>
<a id="Moon" class="anchor" href="#Earth's-Moon" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Moon</h3>

<p>Earth's moon also has a sodium atmosphere similar to Mercury's. During the <a href="http://lcross.arc.nasa.gov/impact.htm">LCROSS</a> impact, colleagues at McDonald Observatory recorded a time series of a plume of sodium extending some 200 km above the impact site. A simulation of these data is in the works, for comparison with Mercury where no sodium signature of the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/messenger/main/">MESSENGER</a> impact was observed. <a href="RIPS.html">RIPS</a> also took some really interesting data of the lunar atmosphere during its comissioning at Lowell Observatory last March and this model is going to be critial in interpreting those results. </p>
